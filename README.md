# Hardhat Project for Building A Decentralized Exchange Protocol to Securely Trade Non-Web3 MMORPG Game Accounts

This project demonstrates a implementation of Tokenizing Existing Non-web3 MMOPRG Game Accounts(Eg: FreeFire, PUBG, PES, ClashOfClans etc) and a Protocol to Trade them on-chain. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
```
